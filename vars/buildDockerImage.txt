Build a docker image with the name from microserviceName
Note that the tag is set to the latest commit tag retrieved from Git and currently this version does not support overriding it.

i.e. does a docker build -t microserviceName [latest commit tag]

<p style="font-size:14px;"><strong>microserviceName</strong><br><span style="text-indent:40px;display:inline-block;">the name of the project to build a docker image for</span></p>
